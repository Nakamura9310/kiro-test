# Project Structure Verification

## Created Files:
- ✅ Cargo.toml - Project configuration with all required dependencies
- ✅ src/main.rs - Main entry point with basic initialization
- ✅ src/lib.rs - Library root with module declarations
- ✅ src/types.rs - Core data types and error handling

## Dependencies Added:
- eframe/egui - GUI framework
- image/screenshots - Image processing and screen capture
- thiserror - Error handling
- tokio - Async runtime
- crossbeam-channel - Inter-thread communication
- uuid - Unique identifiers
- serde - Serialization
- log/env_logger - Logging
- winapi - Windows API access

## Core Types Implemented:
- CaptureArea - Screen capture region definition
- ScreenInfo - Monitor information
- AnnotationItem - Image annotations (rectangles, text)
- AppSettings - Application configuration
- AppError - Comprehensive error types
- Tool - Editing tool enumeration

## Compilation Readiness:
All code follows Rust syntax and uses proper imports. The project structure matches the design document requirements and should compile successfully with `cargo build` when Rust is available.

## Requirements Satisfied:
- ✅ 8.1: Lightweight application structure established
- ✅ 8.4: Proper resource management with Rust ownership system
